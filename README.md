Pneumonia Detection System
ðŸ“œ Overview
The Pneumonia Detection System is a deep learning-based project designed to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system aims to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing pneumonia effectively and efficiently.

âœ¨ Features
Dataset Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, augmentation, and normalization.
Deep Learning Model: Implements CNNs for high-accuracy classification of chest X-ray images.
Evaluation Metrics: Includes performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Result Visualization: Provides confusion matrix and performance graphs.
